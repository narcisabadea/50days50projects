          <div class="answer">
            A: Green. Humans can differentiate 10 million different colors, but
            it’s hard to imagine the mirror is not white or silver. It is
            actually the color of whatever is reflected onto it. The perfect
            mirror reflects all images in the exact opposite direction (angle of
            reflection) and distance. So the color of the mirror would be kind
            of smart white.

          <div class="answer">
            A: Nowhere, it is still there.
            Do they just wiped out, do they go off somewhere where you can never get them back or do they send it to the President. Well, the answer is your computer doesn’t delete anything, they are right there in your hard disk.
            When you delete a file, you just change a pointer to the new address on your hard disk. Pointers are a special type of data that points to the location (Track/Cylinder/Sector of the hard drive) where the actual file is stored. Large files are usually stored in multiple locations. When you open a file, the hard drive follows the pointer to present the data.

          <div class="question">Q: What Is The Resolution Of The Human Eye?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            A: 576 Megapixels. 
              The Digital images are made of millions of tiny tiles-like elements. The more these tiny elements (called pixels), the more will be the resolution. A single megapixel is equivalent to one million pixels in an image.
              If you know the width and height of an image, you can calculate how many pixels your camera gets (by simply multiply them). Also, the megapixels have nothing to do with the quality of the image. Quality depends on exposure, focus, lighting, camera lens, and various other factors.
              However, the human eye doesn’t work as a digital camera. In good light, you can distinguish two lines if they are separated by at least 0.6 arc minutes, equivalent pixel size is 0.3 arc minutes. Now, if you take a 120-degree horizontal field and 60-degree vertical plane as your total plane of view. Then the resolution of your eye would be:
              120 * 120 * 60 * 60 / (0.3 * 0.3) = 576000000 pixels = 576 Megapixels

          <div class="question">Q: Which Came First – The Egg or The Chicken?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            A: The Egg
            The egg-laying animals existed way far before the chicken came. So technically, the egg came before the chicken.
            Let’s take the clock many, many moons ago when there were no chickens. A creature very similar to chicken (let’s call it proto-chicken) would have mated with other proto-chicken. The two organisms pass their genes in the form of DNA.
            However, the replication of DNA is never 100% accurate and very often produces a tiny change for the new organism. These tiny changes in DNA could create a new species over thousands of generations. The same happened with proto-chickens, and the small genetic mutation created the new species called chicken, which grew in an egg.

          <div class="question">Q: Does Sunlight Weigh Anything?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            A: Yes (by weight we mean mass).
            Sunlight, composed of photons, reaching the Earth definitely has equivalent mass. That’s the reason the area covered in shadow weighs less than the area being pushed by light.
            The sunlight emitted in a day would be around 3.7*1024 kg.  If you collect all the sunlight in a perfect mirror box, the mass of the box will increase by that amount (because of the photon energy). Furthermore, freely streaming mass-less protons are deflected by gravitational fields.
